# Drowzee

## About

[Pokémon Fusion](http://pokemon.alexonsager.net/) is this really cool
website that lets you generate images of 2 Pokémon fused together.

I live in London. As you may or not may know, London has lots of
Drowzees in Pokémon GO. I mean like, an omg amount.

The purpose of this script is to use Pokémon Fusion and ImageMagick to
generate a more accurate representation of Pokémons that can spawn in
London.

## Source

Dependencies:

* Ruby and [nokogiri](http://www.nokogiri.org/)
* [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php)

### downloadpkmn.rb

This downloads all the Drowzee images and names from Pokémon Fusion.

### drawpkm.rb

This takes all the downloaded images and names and combines them into
a single image using ImageMagick.
